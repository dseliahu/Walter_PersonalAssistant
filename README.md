This is a small pet project of mine. The goal is to make a peronal assistant, similar to Alexa or Google home. It runs on Raspberry Pi, but if you comment out the RPi.GPIO lines it will run on mac too (with proper dependencies installed).

I have made it open source incase anybody stumbles accross it and wants to take a look, but keep in mind the code will be changing and growing as I build. It's in active developement, and early in the project, so I may be making some large changes along the way.

Please reach out if you have any suggestions! I'm very open to feedback, and always looking to improve my code.
