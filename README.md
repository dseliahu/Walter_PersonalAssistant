This is a small pet project of mine. The goal is to make a peronal assistant, similar to Alexa or Google home. It runs on Raspberry Pi, but if you comment out the RPi.GPIO lines it will run on mac too (with proper dependencies installed).

I figured I would open source it incase anybody stumbles accross it, but keep in mind the code will be changing and growing as I build.

Please reach out if you have any suggestions! I'm very open to feedback, and always looking to improve my code.
